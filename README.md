# tiger_detection_yolov3-tiny
This project is detecting tigers from images and vidoes
I used yolov3-tiny in this project.
yolov3-tiny has a better speed compared to yolov3 that is why i used it in this project eventhough i did the same project on yolov3.
But yolov3 has a better accuracy compared to yolov3-tiny.
I did the whole project using google colab GPU.
